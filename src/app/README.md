# AI Odessy

Getting inspiration for writing content is a pain. You end up spending hours reading through posts, trying to connect the dots, and probably missing a bunch of stuff anyway.

That's why I built **SocialSpark**. It's a simple tool that watches Reddit for you and uses AI to figure out what people are actually talking about. Instead of just counting upvotes or keywords, it provides deeper insights.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
